Problem is to decode the following message:

3xvsw8su9k7xlcq39w38uv33q5u5dt260uwb81mwnjjeiku8emau2788t

The message consists of letters and numbers, and the letters in
the encrypted message are fairly evenly spread across all of the letters and numbers.

This suggested base36 encoding:

>>> i = int('3xvsw8su9k7xlcq39w38uv33q5u5dt260uwb81mwnjjeiku8emau2788t',36)
>>> x = "%x" % i
>>> print x
b4529bf40069e45d544cbf4ce15dcb1f781f9e8aa171da562104016aba587302bba75bf7d

That doesn't look like ASCII.

However, there is no y and z in the encrypted message, so base 34 or 35 might work:

>>> i = int('3xvsw8su9k7xlcq39w38uv33q5u5dt260uwb81mwnjjeiku8emau2788t',34)
>>> x = "%x" % i
>>> print x

>>> binascii.unhexlify(x)
'w3_u5ed_a_d4rtb0ard_t0_p1ck_th3_b4se'

It turns out it is base-34.
